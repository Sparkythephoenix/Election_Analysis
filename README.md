Election-Audit Summary**
The code that was used for this analysis can be easily modified and used for any other elections. For example, if data contained gender information of voters, the code could be extended to see the breakdown of voters for each candidate or county. The same could be done if data set contained occupation information of voters. All this could be used to determine the target audience for candidates.
